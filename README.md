# Job Find Helper
Job Find Helper is a little program I developed to help me in finding a new job. I decided to write it after some days in which I was needed to open and search for jobs oportunities several times.

This program do this job for me. It make the searchs for jobs in some job portals and call some triggers to notify-me.

# Triggers
Triggers are commands I can pass to the Job Find Helper and It executes when a new job oportunity is found.

# Task lists
